# design-of-experiments

A short tutorial for analyzing a [Design of Experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments) using the [statmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) python library.

For this example, I'm going to use the dataset: [CAT/TEMP/PRES/CONC EFFECT ON CHEMICAL PROCESS CONVERSION YIELD
BOX, HUNTER & HUNTER (1978)](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/education/dex/boxchem.dat), which is available on the [NIST](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/education/datasets.htm) website.
